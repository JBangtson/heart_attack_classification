# Heart Attack Classification and Analysis    

This analysis utilizes Logistic Regression to predict heart attacks ü©∫‚ù§ and examine significant factors related to heart health. The model is able to predict heart attacks with an overall accuracy of 85%, trained on around 240 heart attack cases.

Key Metrics Summary:
Overall Accuracy: 85%
Precision (Heart Disease): 0.871
Recall (Heart Disease): 0.844
F1-Score (Heart Disease): 0.857 (1.0 is max and 100% accuracy, 0 is min)

## Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

- AUC-ROC score quantifies the overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes:
  - AUC = 1.0: Perfect classifier. This model has an absolute difference of 0.07.
  - AUC = 0.5: No discrimination (random guessing).
  - AUC < 0.5: Worse than random guessing (the model is likely reversed in its predictions).

- True Positive Rate (TPR): Also known as sensitivity or recall, it measures the proportion of actual positives correctly predicted by the model.
  - TPR = True Positives (TP) / (True Positives (TP) + False Negatives (FN))

- False Positive Rate (FPR): It measures the proportion of actual negatives incorrectly predicted as positive.
  - FPR = False Positives (FP) / (False Positives (FP) + True Negatives (TN))

- The ROC curve plots TPR on the y-axis against FPR on the x-axis at various threshold values of the classification model.
